Spring always brings lots of transplanting and trimming.   With the quarantine in effect, this is an excuse to me in nature, well in my back yard.

# Hackberry

Here is how we started out

Taking this guy out of the pot definitely shows that it is starting to get root-bound.

Untangling the roots

Trimmed and ready to go back in the same pot.   The pot is the right size for this tree.

Fast forward to a bit of trimming from the top, a soak in Superthrive, and we are good to go.
