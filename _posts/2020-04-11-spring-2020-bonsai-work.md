Spring always brings lots of transplanting and trimming.   With the quarantine in effect, this is an excuse to be in nature, well in my back yard.

# Hackberry

Here is how we started out

Taking this guy out of the pot definitely shows that it is starting to get root-bound.

Untangling the roots

Trimmed and ready to go back in the same pot.   The pot is the right size for this tree.

Fast forward to a bit of trimming from the top, a soak in Superthrive, and we are good to go.

I am hoping that I've kept the moss alive around the root base.  It's always a bit of a concern when replacing the soil.

# Dward Jade

I am pretty happy with how my Jade is coming along.

Definitely needs root work.

Roots untangled and trimmed.   I didn't take off too much. Just enough for the tree to go back into the same pot comfortably.

I prefer to add a bit for fertilizer when I transplant.  I sprinkle a bit on to of the starting soil before the tree goes in.

Pot is prepped.  Wire set.  Fertilizer is in.

I like to use a chopstick to make sure that the soil makes it into the root ball.

Into the Superthrive bath for 15-20 mins.  Honestly, I am not sure if it does anything, but I've never transplanted my trees without it.  And, yep, it's a litter box.

## Elm
This guy needs a new pot.  I didn't have one that would have worked.  It's a plastic pot for now, until I can find another.

The Elm started out like this.

# Cat tax

The obligatory internet cat tax.   This is Maxie.
